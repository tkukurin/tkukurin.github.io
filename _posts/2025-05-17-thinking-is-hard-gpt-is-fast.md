_All this speed is an illusion._

[Via X](https://x.com/docmilanfar/status/1923613375185158561),
got inspired to find good analogies to Cruyff's quote:

> Speed is often confused with insight. 
> When I start running earlier than the others, I appear faster.

Something poetic in prompting LMs to assist with this task.
No shade to Cruyff, but I like H. Jackson Brown's best --

> Opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor.

Other sports figures with similar insight --

> I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. 
> (Wayne Gretzky)

> Precision beats power, and timing beats speed.
> (Conor McGregor)

> The harder I practice, the luckier I get
> (Gary Player, golf maxim)

To the pithy --

> Chance favors the prepared mind. 
> (Louis Pasteur)

> Never confuse motion for action. 
> (Ernest Hemingway)

> Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
> (US Navy SEAL Proverb)

And the pithy historic --

> Every battle is won before it’s ever fought.
> (Sun Tzu)

> Dress me slowly, I’m in a hurry.
> (attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte)

> Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
> (Seneca)


To the serendipitous finds --

> Vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare.
> (Japanese Proverb)

> Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.
> (Arthur Schopenhauer)


And finally, one recalled without GPT assistance --

> If intelligence is making hard problems easy, genius is making problems go away.
