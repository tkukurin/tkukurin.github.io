Cruyff:

> Speed is often confused with insight.
> When I start running earlier than the others, I appear faster.

## I. Intelligence & Quotes: _All this speed is an illusion._

Something poetic in prompting LMs to find analogies to this.
No shade to Cruyff, but H. Jackson Brown's is best --

> Opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor.

Other sports figures with similar insight --

> I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
> (Wayne Gretzky)

> Precision beats power, and timing beats speed.
> (Conor McGregor)

> The harder I practice, the luckier I get
> (Gary Player, golf maxim)

To the pithy --

> Chance favors the prepared mind.
> (Louis Pasteur)

> Never confuse motion for action.
> (Ernest Hemingway)

> Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
> (US Navy SEAL Proverb)

To the pithy historic --

> Every battle is won before it's ever fought.
> (Sun Tzu)

> Dress me slowly, I'm in a hurry.
> (attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte)

> Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
> (Seneca)

To the serendipitous finds --

> Vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare.
> (Japanese Proverb)

> Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.
> (Arthur Schopenhauer)

And finally, one I recalled without GPT assistance --

> Stupidity is making easy problems hard.
> Intelligence is making hard problems easy.
> Genius is making hard problems go away.

## II. Intelligence & Krakauer: _Comfortably dumb_

Krakauer on IQ [@36m40s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=36m40s):
"The concept is useless. I would dispute the _g_ concept of intelligence."

His example: young Mozart.
Perfect pitch, note-for-note score recall.
Why? His father was a tyrant who drilled it into him and his sister.
Deliberate practice can yield extraordinary skills.
(We know _g_ mostly measures working memory.)

NB:
1. Why no mention of the Polgar sisters?
2. Mozart's sister got the same drilling—why didn't she become equally extraordinary?

Re (2): he does say _there are innate variations_ [@39m31s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=39m31s).
But does this not do the heavy lifting here?

Broadly I agree. Perhaps variance in innate ability suppresses variance in environment.
By "environment" I mean: Mozart's tyrannical father.

On representation [@43m22s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=43m22s):
Roman numerals make math inefficient.
Meanwhile in India/Arabia, the same calculations were effortless.
Cultural transmission matters. This is what Krakauer calls a "**Complementary Cognitive Artefact**."

Other complementary artefacts [@47m2s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=47m2s):
* **The Abacus**. Expert users grow "an abacus" in their cortex—activity shifts from language to visuo-spatial areas. The object restructures the brain.
* **Maps**
* Sextant, quadrant, etc. Familiarity reduces dependence.

Opposite: **competitive** artefacts [@49m38s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=49m38s):
* Calculator. Me + phone = smart. Remove phone = no benefit. The artefact **replaces** rather than **amplifies**.
* Machine learning. He mentions AlphaGo, but **I'm not convinced**. Human strategy in many games improves via computer tools. Can the same artefact be competitive in one context, complementary in another? (Cf. maps above.)
* Cars. Efficient movement. Remove the car, you're no better than before. Worse, actually.
* (My addition) Glasses.

We accept these tradeoffs because **utility is so high**.
Glasses, calculators, cars—modern life requires them.

Missed this on first read:

> **the real discussion that we should be having is that might be a discussion in a hundred years time**
> but the imminent and practical debate is what to do about competitive cognitive artifacts
> that are already leaving an impression on our brains that is arguably negative.

Sam says David is making normative claims despite claiming otherwise [@58m20s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=58m20s).
The normativity enters via "we want to be better."
David [@59m10s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=59m10s): "I agree there are better ways of being—imagine still coding on punched cards."

But in his framework, wouldn't programming languages be ambiguous?
They _replace_ our ability to code in binary—competitive.
Yet they provide abstractions for thinking that binary never could—complementary.

Not sure what I think about this.
