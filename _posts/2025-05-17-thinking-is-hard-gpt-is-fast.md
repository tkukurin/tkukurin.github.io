[Via X](https://x.com/docmilanfar/status/1923613375185158561),
got inspired to find good analogies to Cruyff's quote:

> Speed is often confused with insight. 
> When I start running earlier than the others, I appear faster.

## I. Intelligence & Quotes: _All this speed is an illusion._

Something poetic in prompting LMs to assist with this task.
No shade to Cruyff, but I like H. Jackson Brown's best --

> Opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor.

Other sports figures with similar insight --

> I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. 
> (Wayne Gretzky)

> Precision beats power, and timing beats speed.
> (Conor McGregor)

> The harder I practice, the luckier I get
> (Gary Player, golf maxim)

To the pithy --

> Chance favors the prepared mind. 
> (Louis Pasteur)

> Never confuse motion for action. 
> (Ernest Hemingway)

> Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
> (US Navy SEAL Proverb)

And the pithy historic --

> Every battle is won before it’s ever fought.
> (Sun Tzu)

> Dress me slowly, I’m in a hurry.
> (attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte)

> Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
> (Seneca)


To the serendipitous finds --

> Vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare.
> (Japanese Proverb)

> Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see.
> (Arthur Schopenhauer)


And finally, one I recalled without GPT assistance --

> Stupidity is making easy problems hard.
> Intelligence is making hard problems easy.
> Genius is making hard problems go away.
> ([David Krakauer](https://nautil.us/ingenious-david-krakauer-235383/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))


## II. Intelligence & Krakauer: _Comfortably dumb_

[With reference to great interview](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=32m0s)

Krakauer: The concept of IQ is useless. [@36m40s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=36m40s) 
"I would dispute the _g_ concept of intelligence."

The example he gives is young Mozart.
Acquired perfect pitch, could recollect scores note-for-note, etc.
Because his father was a tyrant who drilled into Mozart and his sister all of this.
Normally he would not have acquired this.
Via deliberate practice you can acquire extraordinary skills.
We know that _g_ measures working memory and that strongly correlates with many tasks.

NOTE to self around two things:
1. Why does Krakauer not mention Polgar sisters?
2. How does he explain the fact that Mozart's sister did not become _equally_ extraordinary as Mozart?

Re (2): he does say _there are innate variations_ [@39m31s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=39m31s).
But does this not do the heavy lifting here?

Broadly I do agree with him, perhaps this variance in preferences or natural ability should suppress the variance in environment.
And by environment, I mean e.g. "Mozart's tyrannical father".

On the importance of representation [@43m22s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=43m22s)
Krakauer makes it explicit how e.g. Roman numerals make it inefficient to perform math.
In India / Arabia, they would at the same time be able to effortlessly perform the same calculations.
This is a good example of cultural transmission.
This is also a good example of what he calls a "**Complementary Cognitive Artefact**."

Other complementary artefacts [@47m2s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=47m2s)
* **The Abacus**. Expert users actually modify their brain s.t. they have "an abacus" in their cortex.
  * It _shifts_ from language to visuo-spatial areas.
  * An object in the world is restructuring the brain intelligently.
* **Maps**
* Sextant, Quadrant, etc. As you become familiar with them, you need to use them less and less.

Opposite of complementary artefacts (**competitive**) [@49m38s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=49m38s)
* Calculator. Me and my phone are very smart. But if we take (the phone) away, I didn't get any benefit. The artefact does not **amplify** but rather **replace** my ability.
  * This is not a _normative_ recommendation.
* Of course, Machine Learning.
  * He mentions AlphaGo, however **I am not convinced** that this is 100% true. Famously it seems that human strategy in many games is positively modulated by the use of computer tools.
    * So is it possible that in some contexts the artefact is competitive, while in others complementary? Is it not similar with **maps** mentioned above?!
* A car. Clearly allows us to move more efficiently along a surface. But take it away, and you are not any better than before (in fact, worse).
* (he does not mention this but came to my mind) Glasses.

We accept the tradeoffs because **the utility value of these artefacts is so high**.
Glasses, calculators, cars; modern world would not work without them.

I missed this on the original read:

> **the real discussion that we should be having is that might be a discussion in a hundred years time**
> but the imminent and practical debate is what to do about competitive cognitive artifacts
> that are already leaving an impression on our brains that is arguably negative.

Sam claims David is making normative claims even though he says he's not. [@58m20s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=58m20s)
Normative claims in his mind enter via "we (as humans) want to be better."
David: "I agree there are in some domains better ways of being, e.g. imagine we would still be writing code on punched cards or binary." [@59m10s](https://youtu.be/cs1ubY8efVY?t=59m10s)

But I suppose in his framework, computer languages would be ambiguous?
They are not _complementary_ in the sense that they replace our ability to code in binary; however, they are somewhat complementary because they provide an efficient abstraction for thinking about code that binary could never offer.
Not sure what I think about this TBH.
