* *Post status*: incomplete thinking, I'm workshopping timeboxed writing.
* *In plain words*: This post is supposed to argue what technical interviews
  look like in the coming years.
* *Writing style*: Weird math formalism interspersed with literary references.

**NB**
_The irony of allowing incomplete thoughts in a post trying to argue for
clarity of expression does not escape me._


## Prologue: Cracks in the Coding Interview

For a long while, in technical hiring we **axiomatized (A1)** 
to _screen for smarts and everything follows_
by proxying core competencies via **algorithmic interviews.**

Per [Goodhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law),
the signal in this system has arguably been dropping for a long while
setting up **lemma (L1)**.
The world [cracked the coding interview](https://amzn.to/4rfybE8)
by memorizing
mildly difficult algorithms
to get hired in high-paying
yet not necessarily intellectually fulfilling jobs.


## Storyline: The Clawding Interview

Having established **(L1)**,
we continue to espouse **Axiom (A2)**: 
most code will soon be generated through the lens of a very high level 
[Turing-complete-test-clearing stochastic compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).

This poses a natural question of whether _general smarts_ 
as proxied by the already highly noisy process (A1)
suffices to select for the next generation of technical prowess?

To a degree perhaps; but more specifically,
the next generation of technical talent
needs to be able to efficiently _start_ the compiler
and to efficiently _verify the work_ of such a compiler.

**Conjecture**:
Therefore, the core competencies to test become:
(1) on the compiler-input side, _clarity of thought_;
(2) on the compiler-output side, _taste and diligence_.


## Epilogue: The limits of my language are the limits of my world

Enter, the _literary interview_.

> If people cannot write well, they cannot think well. If they cannot think
> well, others will do their thinking for them. — George Orwell

Some suggested formats:
1. Joint code review over subtly wrong code.
2. Crystallizing requirements in writing, on-the-spot
3. Roleplay with the interviewer-as-LLM.
4. Combine algorithmic with coding-agent interview: what _would_ you have prompted a coding agent to implement this?
