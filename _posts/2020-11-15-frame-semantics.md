Cf. [functionalists]({% post_url 2020-11-12-chomsky-v-functionalists %}),
[embodied language]({% post_url 2020-11-10-language-remodelling-embodied-language-understanding %})
and [placing language in an integrated understanding system]({% post_url 2020-11-16-placing-language-in-an-integrated-understanding-system %}).

In the late 1960s Charles Fillmore proposes case grammar, system of linguistic
analysis which consists of semantic roles (Agent A, Object O, Beneficiary B,
etc.) required by a specfic verb. E.g. verb *to give* in "A gave O to B".

This was later extended to [Frame Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_semantics_(linguistics)),
according to which lexical units evoke specific frames of semantic knowledge.

## [Embodied construction grammar in simulation-based language understanding](https://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nchang/pubs/ecg.pdf)

Cf. mainstream Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995; Fillmore 1988; Kay and
Fillmore 1999; Lakoff 1987) and Cognitive Grammar (Langacker 1991).

Source of linguistic knowledge consists of form and meaning.
This approach models analysis and simulation phases.
