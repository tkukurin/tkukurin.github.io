Dataclasses are cool, but what's cooler is using immutable structures as your
default parameters. Do it like so:

```python
import dataclasses as dc

@dc.dataclass(frozen=True)
class MinCut:
  T:set = dc.field(
    default_factory=set, compare=False)
  F:set = dc.field(
    default_factory=set, compare=False)
```

Also check out [some more magic in the official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html).
Of note: representation, `__post_init__` hooks, `dataclasses.replace` fields.
